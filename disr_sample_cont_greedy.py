    This function implements a distributed sampling continuous greedy algorithm.

    Args:
        A_to_B (dict): A dictionary where keys are professors (A), and values are lists of venues (B) that each professor has.
        B_length (int): The total number of venues (B).
        t (int): Number of communication rounds.
        k (int): Number of top venues to keep for each professor in vector v.
        num_gradient_estimation_samples (int): Number of samples to use for gradient estimation.
        client_sample (float): Fraction of professors (A) to sample.
